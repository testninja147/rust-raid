# Rust-Raid Common Library

Rust-raid's `common` library is a library package and a `workspace` dependency
that gets imported into other packages to reduce code duplication. However you
might see some examples that does not use the methods or structures defined in
the `_common` package just to explain more in their respective executable
section without using library.
