# TODO-WEB

The `todo` web application project is intended to show another use-case of
rust-lang. This project demonstrates a basic Web server to serve static contents
as well as a REST API to perform CRUD operations.

> **NOTE**:
_This is just a demo project and all the operations used here are not well_
_tested for any production use. You could however use this workspace as a_
_boilerplate for starting the web application._

To run the server, run the following command

```
cargo run --bin todo
```
The server will be served to the following URL:

- <http://localhost:8080/> or
- <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>
